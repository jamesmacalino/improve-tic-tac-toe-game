##  The purpose of this project was to 

### This project was part of an exercise where over time, I took a tic-tac-toe game and added improvements.

### The improvements were:

### Display the next player to play (Player X or Player O). This should show which player’s turn it is. 
### It should be updated every time a player selects a square
### Update the color of the mark based on the player’s turn. “X” should be red, and “O” should be white.
